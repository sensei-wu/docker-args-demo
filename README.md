# A step by step comparison of ENTRYPOINT and CMD commands of docker

## Theory

Both ENTRYPOINT and CMD are commands which are used for customizing the startup behavior of a container.

Both commands can be used interchangeably to serve similar purposes, but nevertheless 
there are subtle differences between them.

ENTRYPOINT is the right way to specify a startup command for a container.

CMD is meant to be used for passing arguments to the startup command specified by ENTRYPOINT.

On top of that, both commands could be executed either in _shell_ mode or _exec_ mode.

In shell mode, the command is executed from within a shell whereas in exec mode, it is executed directly.

In the following sections, I'd like to demonstrate how these differences play out in practice by using the classic 
[fortune](https://linux.die.net/man/6/fortune) program which prints out a random quote each time it is invoked.

We install fortune inside an alpine linux base image and then invoke the program using `CMD` or `ENTRYPOINT`.
We will inspect the difference between shell and exec mode and also check out how we can pass arguments to the 
container while running the container.

#### v1: without a CMD or ENTRYPOINT

If you fail to specify at-least one of CMD or ENTRYPOINT, your containers won't execute anything.
```
FROM alpine
RUN apk --update add fortune
```

`$ docker image build -t docker-args-demo:v1 .`

```
$ docker run --rm docker-args-demo:v1
$
```

#### v2: Using CMD in shell form

```
FROM alpine
RUN apk --update add fortune
CMD "fortune"
```

`docker image build -t docker-args-demo:v2 .`

```
$ docker run --rm docker-args-demo:v2
Real Users find the one combination of bizarre input values that shuts
down the system for days.
```

```
$ docker run --rm docker-args-demo:v2 hostname

````

#### v3: Using CMD in exec form

```
FROM alpine
RUN apk --update add fortune
CMD ["fortune"]
```

`$ docker image build -t docker-args-demo:v3 .`

```
$ docker run --rm docker-args-demo:v3

```
$ docker run --rm docker-args-demo:v3 hostname

```

#### v4: Using ENTRYPOINT in shell form

```
FROM alpine
RUN apk --update add fortune
ENTRYPOINT "fortune"
```

`$ docker image build -t docker-args-demo:v4 .`

```
$ docker run --rm docker-args-demo:v4 
America may be unique in being a country which has leapt from barbarism
to decadence without touching civilization.

the other hand", again.
```

#### v5: Using ENTRYPOINT in shell form with non terminating container

```
FROM alpine
RUN apk --update add fortune
ADD fortuneloop.sh /bin/fortuneloop.sh
RUN chmod +x /bin/fortuneloop.sh
ENTRYPOINT /bin/fortuneloop.sh
```

`$ docker image build -t docker-args-demo:v5 .`

```
$ docker run --rm docker-args-demo:v5

sophisticated that nobody gets it any more except Mia Farrow.  All

devil gets her pregnant and Woody Allen should go back to dressing up

This planet has -- or rather had -- a problem, which was this: most of
the people living on it were unhappy for pretty much of the time.  Many
solutions were suggested for this problem, but most of these were
largely concerned with the movements of small green pieces of paper,
which is odd because on the whole it wasn't the small green pieces of
paper that were unhappy.

If money can't buy happiness, I guess you'll just have to rent it.
Brace yourselves.  We're about to try something that borders on the
unique: an actually rather serious technical book which is not only
(gasp) vehemently anti-Solemn, but also (shudder) takes sides.  I tend
to think of it as `Constructive Snottiness.'
